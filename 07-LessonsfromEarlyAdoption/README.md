- Maintain consistent prompt management across departments
- Implement robust security and compliance controls
- Easily switch between different AI models based on specific needs

**Technical Implementation:**

```python
# Python MCP server implementation for customer support
import logging
import asyncio
from modelcontextprotocol import create_server, ServerConfig
from modelcontextprotocol.server import MCPServer
from modelcontextprotocol.transports import create_http_transport
from modelcontextprotocol.resources import ResourceDefinition
from modelcontextprotocol.prompts import PromptDefinition
from modelcontextprotocol.tool import ToolDefinition

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

async def main():
    # Create server configuration
    config = ServerConfig(
        name="Enterprise Customer Support Server",
        version="1.0.0",
        description="MCP server for handling customer support inquiries"
    )
    
    # Initialize MCP server
    server = create_server(config)
    
    # Register knowledge base resources
    server.resources.register(
        ResourceDefinition(
            name="customer_kb",
            description="Customer knowledge base documentation"
        ),
        lambda params: get_customer_documentation(params)
    )
    
    # Register prompt templates
    server.prompts.register(
        PromptDefinition(
            name="support_template",
            description="Templates for customer support responses"
        ),
        lambda params: get_support_templates(params)

    {
        // Create request with appropriate resources and tool access
        var resourceRequest = new ResourceRequest
        {
            Name = "patient_records",
            Parameters = new Dictionary<string, object>
            {
                ["patientId"] = _patientContext.PatientId,
                ["requestingProvider"] = _patientContext.ProviderId
            }
        };
        
        // Request diagnostic assistance using appropriate prompt
        var response = await _mcpClient.SendPromptRequestAsync(
            promptName: "diagnostic_assistance",
            parameters: new Dictionary<string, object>
            {
                ["symptoms"] = symptoms,
                patientHistory = patientHistory,
                relevantGuidelines = _patientContext.GetRelevantGuidelines()
            });
            
        return DiagnosticSuggestion.FromMCPResponse(response);
    }
}
```

## Case Study 6: NLWeb 
MCP (Model Context Protocol) is an emerging protocol for Chatbots and AI assistants to interact with tools. Every NLWeb instance is also an MCP server, which supports one core method, ask, which is used to ask a website a question in natural language. The returned response leverages schema.org, a widely-used vocabulary for describing web data. Loosely speaking, MCP is NLWeb as Http is to HTML. NLWeb combines protocols, Schema.org formats, and sample code to help sites rapidly create these endpoints, benefiting both humans through conversational interfaces and machines through natural agent-to-agent interaction.

There are two distinct components to NLWeb.
- A protocol, very simple to begin with, to interface with a site in natural language and a format, leveraging json and schema.org for the returned answer. See the documentation on the REST API for more details.
- A straightforward implementation of (1) that leverages existing markup, for sites that can be abstracted as lists of items (products, recipes, attractions, reviews, etc.). Together with a set of user interface widgets, sites can easily provide conversational interfaces to their content. See the documentation on Life of a chat query for more details on how this works.
